After examining the source code and playing a little with the executable, I realized the user can insert input twice, 
even though scanf was only called once. I realized the issue was in this critical line:

if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){

At first glance, this appears to check if opening the password file was unsuccessful. However, there's a subtle operator 
precedence issue here. In C, the < operator has higher precedence than =, so this line is actually evaluated as:

if(fd = (open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0)){

When the file opens successfully, open() returns a positive file descriptor (likely 1). The comparison 1 < 0 evaluates to false (0), so we get:

if(fd = 0){

This assigns 0 to fd instead of the actual file descriptor. Since file descriptor 0 is stdin (standard input), the subsequent
read(fd, pw_buf, PW_LEN) is actually reading from user input rather than from the password file.

This means I need to input two values:

1) The first input (when the program expects to read from the password file)
2) The second input (for the password comparison)

These values are then compared after the second input is XORed with 1 (using the xor function) so the second input is equal to the 
first input XORed with 1.

For example, using "AAAAABBBBB" as the first input:

1) 'A' in binary is 01000001
   XORed with 1 gives 01000000, which is '@'
2) 'B' in binary is 01000010
   XORed with 1 gives 01000011, which is 'C'

So if I input "AAAAABBBBB" first, then "@@@@@CCCCC" second, the check passes and I get the flag.
