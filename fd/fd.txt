After transferring the files using scp, I began analyzing the fd.c source code. I quickly noticed that I had complete 
control over the fd variable, which is critically important because it's used as a parameter in the read() function. In
Unix-like systems, file descriptor 0 represents standard input (stdin). Looking at the code, I discovered that the program
subtracts 0x1234 from my input argument. Since 0x1234 in hexadecimal equals 4660 in decimal, running ./fd 4660 would 
result in a file descriptor of 0, allowing me to write directly to the buf variable from stdin. Furthermore, the condition
!strcmp(buf, "LETMEWIN") means the check passes when the strings are equal (the negation of strcmp returning 0). Therefore,
I simply needed to execute ./fd 4660, type LETMEWIN followed by Enter, and the program revealed the flag.
