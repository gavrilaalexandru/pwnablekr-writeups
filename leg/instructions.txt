// key 1

pc goes into r3 at 0x00008cdc; pc contains next_instruction + 4 or
pc = current_instruction + 8
so r3 will have 0x00008ce4

// key 2
pc goes once more in r3 at 0x00008d04; but this time are thumb mode,
represented by the 2-byte increment pattern and instruction size.
pc containts 0x00008d04 + 4 so 0x00008d08
but this time we are also adding 4 into r3
so r3 will have 0x00008d0c

// key 3
now lr goes into r3. lr is link register and it holds the return address when
a function call is made. when the bl instruction is used, lr saves the address
of the instruction immediately after bl so it knows where to return
let's look at the main function now.
the function key3 is called at 0x00008d7c with bl, thus lr stores 0x00008d80
so r3 will have 0x00008d80

// flag

so let's sum up all our keys so far and get the flag

key = 0x00008ce4 + 0x00008d0c + 0x00008d80
key = 108400 or 1A770
